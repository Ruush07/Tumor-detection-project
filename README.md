# Brain Tumor Detection using CNN 🧠

## Project Overview
This project leverages **Deep Learning** and a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to automate the detection of brain tumors from MRI scans. Developed as a mid-term PBL initiative, this tool assists in rapid preliminary diagnosis.

## Key Features
* **Custom 3-Layer CNN**: Optimized for medical image feature extraction.
* **90%+ Accuracy**: High precision in distinguishing between Tumor and Healthy scans.
* **Real-time Visualization**: Generates prediction heatmaps for analysis.

## Tech Stack
* **Core**: Python 3.10
* **Framework**: PyTorch
* **Data**: Kaggle Brain MRI Dataset

## Usage
1.  Clone the repo.
2.  Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3.  Run the notebook `Brain_Tumor_Detection_Using_Pytorch.ipynb`.
